# RMU Complementary Skills Calculator

This module provides Gamemasters with a quick and easy-to-use calculator to automate the RMU complementary skills rules. After selecting one or more tokens on the scene, the GM can click the new icon in the Token Controls palette to open a launcher window. This launcher presents two distinct options: "Boost Skill Check", which is used when multiple skills are combined to help a single roll, and "Calculate Group Task", which is used when a group works together to shorten the time needed for a task.

The "Boost Skill Check" calculator allows the GM to pick a primary actor and their main skill, and then add ranks from other complementary skills (from the same actor or others) to find the final bonus, automatically applying the diminishing returns (half, quarter, etc.) for each added skill.

The "Calculate Group Task" calculator instantly finds the average skill bonus from all participating actors for a specific task and adds the ranks from the designated leader's Leadership skill, providing a single, combined bonus for the group maneuver.

## Rule and examples

1) Complementary skills are skills that work together. This could be a single character that has multiple skills that are applicable to a task, or multiple characters may work together to attempt a task. The GM determines what the primary skill is, and its bonus is used in full. The number of ranks in the first complementary skill (or character) are added, and the ranks of each additional complementary skill (or character) the GM allows is further halved (the 3rd is one-half, the 4th is one-quarter, etc.). The GM is the final arbiter here, and if in doubt or dispute, the default answer as to whether a second skill or character can be used to boost another skill is “no”.

2) Sometimes working together is not about collaboration to improve one’s chances, but rather is about shortening the time needed to perform a task. A group of soldiers may spread out to find something, or a group of cooks may want to put together a 5-course meal. The Gamemaster will assign a difficulty based on the task and situation, and a maneuver using the average skill bonus of all involved is made. Having an effective leader can help a group work more efficiently, thus if there is an acting leader he may add his ranks in his Leadership skill.

*Example*: Roza has a Perception bonus of +90, and is looking for concealed traps as she walks up the corridor. Roza also has 12 ranks in Technical (Traps) with a +80 bonus. The GM decides that Roza’s familiarity with mechanical traps will help her in locating concealed traps, so allows her to add her ranks in Traps as a secondary bonus to her perception. Her skill bonus in Traps is not used. Thus her total bonus is 90 + 12 = +102. Roza’s player argues that since she has 10 ranks in Region Lore for the area she is in, she should get another 10 ÷ 2 = +5 bonus, but the GM rules that knowledge of a large region is not going to be helpful in this case.

*Example*: Roza has a perception bonus of +90, her friend Borlo has a perception of +70, and Borlo’s sister Kamina has a perception bonus of +75 and 10 ranks of leadership. The three friends are attempting to find a key that was thrown into the large, overgrown yard in front of an old house, and the GM states that it would take one person 30 minutes to search the whole yard. Working together, they can search the area faster, Kamina splits up the work and coordinates the effort (putting her leadership into play) and they begin to search. The average of their perception bonuses is (90 + 70 + 75) = 235 / 3 = 78 and adding Kamina’s 10 ranks in leadership gives 88. Just one perception maneuver is made at +88. It would take one person thirty minutes to search, so for three it takes just 10 minutes (30 / 3 = 10), so they get one perception maneuver at +88 for every 10 minutes they spend searching. The GM decides this will be resolved as a Percentage Maneuver, since the key is definitely there in the long grass, and will eventually be found if they keep looking.
